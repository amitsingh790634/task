# Flutter Dynamic UI Configuration Task

## Overview

This project demonstrates a solution for dynamically updating the UI in a Flutter app. The implementation allows real-time changes to the widget layout, position, size, and other properties without modifying the app's source code. The app achieves this by utilizing a configuration-driven approach.


## Reference Design

The app is inspired by the following design provided by the company:

## Key Functionalities

1. Configuration Parsing:
    The app reads a JSON file to fetch UI configurations.
    The JSON defines widget types, properties, layout details,
    and interactivity.


2. Widget Builder:
    A modular widget factory processes the configuration and
    builds Flutter widgets dynamically.
    
    Supports essential widgets like Text, Button, Image
    Container, and custom layouts.

3. Real-Time Updates:

    Integrated with a mechanism to update the UI on-the-fly by   
    modifying the JSON input.
    
    Demonstrates flexibility and adaptability to various design 
    requirements.
